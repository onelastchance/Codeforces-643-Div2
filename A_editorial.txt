Let's calculate the sequence for fixed a1=1: 1,2,6,42,50,50,50,…
We got lucky and the minimal digit has become 0, after that the element has stopped changing because we always add 0.

Actually it is not luck and that will always happen. Note that we add no more than 9⋅9=81 every time, so the difference between two consecutive elements of the sequence is bounded by 81. Assume that we will never have minimal digit equal to 0. Then the sequence will go to infinity. Let's take X=1000(⌊a11000⌋+1). All the numbers on segment [X;X+99] have 0 in hundreds digit, so none of them can be element of our sequence. But our sequence should have numbers greater than X. Let's take the smallest of them, it should be at least X+100. But then the previous number in the sequence is at least (X+100)−81=X+19. It is greater than X but smaller than the minimal of such numbers. Contradiction.

In the previous paragraph we have actually shown that we have no numbers greater than X+100 in our sequence and we will see the number with 0 among first 1001 elements.

That means that we can build the sequence till we find the first number with 0 and then it will repeat forever.

In reality the maximal index of the first elements with 0 is 54 and minimal a1 for that to happen is 28217.
